# cs-testing
## A Platform for testing computer science students
### Not at all finished - App is currently broken becauses of new html pages that weren't linked with js

#### uses firebase auth,firestore


### The future of the project
Fix code => signup/navigation is broken because there are "duplicates of pages" 

Migrate to electron with ReactJS, using electron will make it easier to prevent cheating as it uses a designated window

Migrate to firebase cloud functions as all the logic, post(ing) get(ing), authentication e.t.c. is currently visible to the client

Develop more counter cheat measures => mouse/keyboard activity tracking (more than 15 seconds without input results in notifying teacher so that they check the student's screen/search history)


### Couter-cheat measures
If the user goes on another tab or window they can no longer take the test and the teacher is notified

### U.I.
Uses materialize css - new electron app will use react-bootstrap
